Summary:

I used DOSBox to create an ASCII table as part of a Class Assignment in Fall 2014. 
Also, I used TASM to compile the assembly code.
The assembly language (instruction set) used is from the Intel 8086 processor.

Direction:

1.) Save the file in a folder on the C: directory. Remember the name of the folder and file.
2.) Open DOSbox.
3.) Type "mount c C:/"
4.) Type C:
5.) Go to the directory of the file that you saved. 




What I learned:

1.) Basic Intel 8086 instruction set such as registers 
2.) Don't create graphics using assembly.
3.) Intel assembly code syntax  difference between com file and exe file.
4.) How to install and use TASM an assembler.
5.) Learned how to use loops, and condition instructions.
6.) Learn about interrupts.
