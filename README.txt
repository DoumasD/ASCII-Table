Summary:

I used DOSBox to create an ASCII table as part of a Class Assignment in Fall 2014. 
The assembly language (instruction set) used is from the Intel 8086 processor.

Direction:

1.) Save the file "project1.asm" in a folder on the C: directory. Remember the name of the folder and file.
2.) Open DOSbox.
3.) Type "mount c C:/"
4.) Type C:
5.) Go to the directory of the file that you saved. 
6.) Type tasm project1.asm
7.) Type tlink project1
8.) Type project1




What I learned:

1.) Basic Intel 8086 instructions and registers. 
2.) Don't create graphics using assembly.
3.) Intel assembly code syntax; the difference between com file and exe file.
4.) How to install and use TASM, an assembler.
5.) Learned how to use loops, and condition instructions.
6.) Learn about interrupts.
7.) Learned about code segment and data segment.

Commands to assemble asm file.
